# Agenda / Approach for next week.
Overall, We will run a DTW 'lite' to give you experience as a participant, which will help you give advice to future participants.
While we do this, we will segway into whatever conceptual background we need to. 

For each, I would like you to bring an example from your past (or present).

# Monday 
+ The Lazy J Curve --> An example of a project or initiative that took way to long to deliver less than expected value. 
+ Using the IOTA Model --> A product idea (doesnt have to be software) that we can test. 

# Tuesday
+ The ELSA Model --> An example of a change initiative that stalled or failed.
+ Technology Mentoring --> Any client example. (Facilitated by Scott and Richard)

# Wednesday
+ Overflow time.
+ Discussion of sales motion etc. General discussion of how to build the practise at Chef. We could even do an IOTA / ELSA model for it.
