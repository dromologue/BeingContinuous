# ShiftLeft

## Context
Certain tasks are often left unitl late in the process flow before being done. It can be extremely cost effective to do these tasks earlier in the process.

## Forces
+ Failure gets more expensive the "closer" the product gets to the customer
+ Lack of understanding of the optimal order for tasks to be completed
+ bottlenecks create workarounds that are not optimal.

## Solution
Instead of waiting till something pops out of the end of a process to test it, the testing is moved to as early as is practical in the process.  Sometimes a subset of the testing is done earlier.
