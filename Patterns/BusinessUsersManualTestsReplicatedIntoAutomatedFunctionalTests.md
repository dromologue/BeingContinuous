# BusinessUsersManualTestsReplicatedIntoAutomatedFunctionalTests

## Context
Business users, will test an application as soon as it is updated.  Their use cases are very valuable and should be fed back into the test cycle.

## Forces
+ Desire to check the output quality of the Dev/Ops process
+ Communication from Dev/Ops to the business is poor.
+ Business uses simply do not trust the IT department to deliver working code. 

## Solution
Discuss with the business users what tests they are running, understand their concerns and replicate their test steps with automated testing, putting this testing into the CD pipeline for all future releases
