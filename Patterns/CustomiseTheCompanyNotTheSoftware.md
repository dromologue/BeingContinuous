# CustomiseTheCompanyNotTheSoftware

## Context
Often there are two choices, customise the software to fit the company, or customise the company to fit the software 

## Forces
+ Desire to customise everything for the special snowflake that is "the company"
+ Only knowledgable folks inside the company could possibly understand the complexity of how things are done in "the company"
+ Often few people ( if any - be honest! ) actually understand the end to end process workflow of their deparment/unit.  
+ Large project mentality means that anything new, has to have a full implementation budget etc...
+ Existing project teams want to form a new project to customise the new implementation
+ Customisation seems like the "right thing to do"
+ COTS software perceived as "cheap".

## Solution
For COTS ( Common Off The Shelf Software ), it is often easier ( and less costly! ) to modify the company slightly to match the shared common practices in the software.
