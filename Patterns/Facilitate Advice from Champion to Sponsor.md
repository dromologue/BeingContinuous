# Facilitate Advice from Champion to Sponsor

## Context
The champion of change, either technical or business oriented, needs to communicate progress and roadblocks to the executive sponsor of the change. 

## Forces
+ technical people are not always confident enough to approach executives.
+ Consultants advising on the change process usually have access to executive level sponsors as they pay the bills. 
+ Roadblocks to progress may be communicated by many different stakeholders with differing perspectives. 
+ Technical roadblocks may not always be understood or given the priority they deserve by executives that do not understand their impact. 

## Solution
Therefore, the consultant should facilitate a regular meeting between technical champions and the executive sponsor; with the objective being the translation of technical concerns into organisational actions that the sponsor needs to take. e.g. resource allocation.
