# Guide Champions to Converge

## Context
Champions tend to become deeply immersed in their projects as they dedicate themselves to leading the change. Every project brings with its own challenges and issues and champions many have different perspectives and experiences from each other. 

## Forces
+ One-on-one discussions between consultants and champions surface details that are not made explicit during group conversations. 
+ Champions may come from different parts of the organisation and be wary to talking to eachother or find little opportunity to do so.


## Solution
Arrange one-on-one conversations with every champion identified in the organisation. In those conversations ensure that you enable them to support each other by sharing what others are doing and where each may be able to help or be helped.
