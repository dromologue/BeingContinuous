# First Project Sets the Tone

## Context
A project is required to initiate change - creating a crucible within which the changed behaviours can be experienced. 

## Forces
+ Artificial example projects used to teach principles or behaviours have the negative association of never being exactly what is found in _this_ organisation. 
+ Real world projects can often expose so many complex variables and situations within an organisation that they obscure the learning. 

## Solution

Apply the following checklist in the selection of an initial project from within the organisation:
[] Technically non-trivial
[] Technically modern
[] Commercially non-critical
[] Commercially innovative
[] Product Owner present and committed
[] Developers and Operations people familiar with the dependent systems available.
