# First Project Sets the Tone

## Context
A project is required to initiate change - creating a crucible within which the changed behaviours can be experienced.

## Forces
+ Artificial example projects rarely excercise the complete process of getting something into the hands of a customer and operationalising it
+ In order to truly believe disruptive change is possible, people need to see a non-trivial example in the context of their own organisation.
+ Real world projects can often expose so many complex variables and situations within an organisation that they obscure the learning.

## Solution

Apply the following checklist in the selection of an initial project from within the organisation:
* [ ] Technically non-trivial
* [ ] Technically modern
* [ ] Commercially non-critical
* [ ] Commercially innovative
* [ ] Product Owner present and committed
* [ ] Developers and Operations people familiar with the dependent systems available.
