# DontConfigureFullStackFirst

## Context
Going from no automation to full automation, is a journey not a destination.  Try to do thin slices of work that delvier value to customers, not large monolithic projects.

## Forces
+ Desire to have the entire end to end stack automated before you "go-live" to production
+ Waterfall project mentality, leads to a preference for large projects with large deliverables
+ Business uses expecting "magic" from automation

## Solution
Do thin slices of automation that deliver value to customers, this may be internal or external customers. Slowly overtime iterate towards the full stack configuration/deployment
