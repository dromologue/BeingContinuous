# LetDoersDo

## Context
Hands on people ( Doers ) are a limited resource in the enterprise, so, care has to be taken to allow them the time to act.

## Forces
+ Desire for Talkers ( opposite of Doers ) to induce a "slow death by many meetings"  
+ Doers so busy doing, they are not aware of political movements around them
+ Ratio of Talker to Doers so high, the Doers get drowned out.
+ Talkers waiting inline for the Doers to do ( what is taking them so long..... )

## Solution
The talkers have to help the Doers, by not just talking less, and giving them time to do,  but by actualy Doing themselves.
