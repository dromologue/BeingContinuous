## Forces
+ Desire to control every aspect of machines, from sizing, storage, networking to longevity. 
+ Communication channels follow conway's law
+ As soon as you create inventory, or lists, someone, somewhere wants to be the "keeper of the list".
+ "Keepers" tendency to make "quality gates" ( instead of notifications ).

## Solution
Remove obstacles that cause frition in the process of providing a machine.  Allow developers to self provision.  Auto Cull machines at defined periods. Reduce frcition.
