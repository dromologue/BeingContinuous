# MentorNotMonitor

## Context
Scrum masters, project managers, Agile coaches, team leads all need someone to talk to.  How do we provide that someone?

## Forces
+ Continuous change in the organisation, forces folks driving it, to question themselves and seek answers
+ Being so close to the action, desire to simply record and report. 
+ Work based cummunication tends to be very formalised, and rigid in structure ( conway's law in action ) 
+ Danger of chinese whispers, if "loose lips sink ships", mentality does not pervail.
+ Excessive use of KPI's ( Key Performance Indicators ).  Too many too often.

## Solution
Provide a Mentor, who can have weekly hourly chats with their hosts.  These are inteded to be 1 on 1, and take the form of infromal chats, with the aim of supporting the host and keeping them on track.
