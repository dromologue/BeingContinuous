# Shared context between Consultants

## Context
Every consultant possesses different skills and specialities. In every interaction they encounter challenges or situations that could benefit from the skills of the others consultants. 

## Forces
+ Justin is perfect.
+ Consultants are split across multiple projects and or meetings making the sharing of information difficult. 
+ Preparation for every eventuality in meetings is impossible. As is, the presence of all consultants in every meeting. 
+ Every problem has its own context and the resolution of the problem has as much to do with the context as the individual problem itself. 

## Solution
Therefore, arrange a regular meeting between consultants to share progress and knowledge of the current context of the engagement. The update should take the following form:

_if_ [we or person x] does [y] _then_ [this will happen] _AND_ [this] is [stopping or making] [us or x] do this.
