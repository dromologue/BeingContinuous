# DontCountHorses

## Context
The stable door is open, it was not bolted, the horses have escaped.  What to do?

## Forces
+ Desire to find the horses and count them
+ If you have to count them, you need a system to record the counting ( +GPS )
+ If all this needs a system, then we need supervision for the system
+ Now we need reporting, KPI's, etc.

## Solution
Prevention is better than cure.  Don't invest in detection systems, invest in prevention systems.  It is the only cost effective way.  This also leads into [Shift Left](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/blob/master/Patterns/ShiftLeft.md "Shift Left")
