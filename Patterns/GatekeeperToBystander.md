# GatekeeperToBystander

## Context
As part of removing roadblocks to high velocity delivery of software, gatekeepers are blockers, and as such can be moved into a bystander role, where they are able to observe ( be notified ), but not stop proceedings ( except in exceptional circumstances ). 

## Forces
+ Desire to be important/needed, leads to roadblocking as gatekeeper.
+ Lack of trust in the people and process, leads to layers of supervision ( gatekeepers ).
+ Low understanding of process from gatekeepers.
+ Being involved in the design of the process, leads to confidence in the process

## Solution
Test as early in the process as possible( Shift left ), as part of the process design for the given gatekeeper's area(s) of concern. Notify person of successful outcomes, otherwise FAIL process.
