## Context
As every project progresses it is inevitable that people will fall ill or take holidays. When this happens, it can derail the project if the absentee is the only person who knows how a specific technology or process works. 

## Forces
 + specialist knowledge is difficult to train to an equal level across many people. 
 + specialist often do not have time to train others while performing their specialist tasks.
 + Vendors need someone to train to become specialists and it is easier for them to train one person. 

## Solution 
Ensure that every specialist in automation, pipeline design, testing etc., once trained is assigned a shadow who can learn through practise. 
Ensure that every specialism is trained to at least three resources initially.
