#  	DemonstrateToStakeholders

## Context
Stakeholders hold the keys to the kingdom.  All doors on your journey are locked until you charm the keeper of the keys.  Make progress easy, use a key

## Forces
+ Do'ers are too busy to chat to stakeholders.  
+ Communication from technical folks to stakeholders ( and vice versa ) is poor, and often times neglected
+ Business understanding of the solution often does not reach the implementors.
+ Stakeholders not exposed to the technical effort inovled in "small changes"
+ Business goals unaffected by technical difficulty ( due to lack of appreciation of difficulty involved )
+ Technical details overwhelm the business goals ( buy a bigger wheel, it will go faster! )

## Solution
Demonstrate on a weekly basis to the stakeholders, what it is the team has done in the last week, how this meets the goal, and how the feedback from small incements has affected future direction.
