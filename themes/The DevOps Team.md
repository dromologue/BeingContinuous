# The DevOps team

## Context

Many of the organisations we have worked with start out by asking us to help them with getting some automation around VM/OS provisioning. Its a great place to start because:-

* It's low hanging fruit (if we keep it simple)
* it's a foundational platform that reduces friction for developers to get apps to production

We take a few of our best infrastructure operations folks and one or two developers who have some experience or interest in infrastructure and we make a "DevOps team"

Within a few weeks the DevOps team have the provisioning time down from 6 weeks to 15 minutes and everyone feels excited and optimistic for the future.

## The problems

Developers see the new provisiong process as a low friction way to get VM's for their apps and experiments.

The "DevOps team" becomes 100% utilised customising the build, writing deployment automation and doing operational support for all the apps that use the new platform.

The developers in product teams start to get frustrated at the bottleneck and wonder how this is better than the old way. They are unable to help out because they don't have the knowledge about how we built it or the access to operate or improve it.


## Solutions

* Make the provisioning process very simple and make it self-service
* Create communities of practice to develop and maintain the platforms

* Identify a small number of product teams that want to use DevOps very early on
* Spread the DevOps team members across early adopter product teams to disseminate knowledge

* Developers write wrappers around infrastructure code to perform customisation
* Developers write application deployment code
* Developers support their own infrastructure, middleware and applications
