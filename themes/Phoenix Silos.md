# Phoenix silos

As we begin to adopt ALDO (Agile, LEAN, DevOps, Outcomes) practices, we very quickly find our speed and quality are constrained by silos and the rigid processes that move work between them.

## What's a Silo
Silo's are pockets of resource that focus on a specific area of work such as security, compliance, firewall administration, storage administration, database administration etc. In the industrial age, this specialisation was helpful to improve quality and reduce costs but it made our innovation process slow and inflexible.

As the requirement to innovate at high velocity becomes more important we are forced to break down the silos and spread skills more broadly across product teams so that work is not blocked by:-

* process bottlenecks like approvals queues.
* skilled resource contention

## What's a Phoenix Silo
Its a silo that keeps rising from ashes...

Unfortunately we have been conditioned over many years that we can only trust experts to do a job correctly. Its not acceptable to do the job adequately.

We believe we have to categorise and aggregate work into silos and place supervision process around them to control the quality of work passed between them.

Silos imply a group of people under some kind of leader with strong team bonds and loyalty. We cannot underestimate the fear we cause when people no longer understand their value to the organisation or we take away the power implied by their ownnership of an empire.

The desire to operate in silos is so strong that as fast as you destroy them they re-form with a different name. We call these "Phoenix Silos"

## How do I recognise one

The most common phoenix silos you will find (and we see this in almost every organisation we work with) are:-

* **The core DevOps team** - Usually the first folks to get involved in a DevOps/Agile pilot project. They are usually drawn from an infrastructure operations team and asked to find a way to spin up VM's on demand for application developers. Wherever we move them, they are the only people who understand how to do it, and so they spend the rest of their lives spinning up VM's for Devs. Invest in [self service provisioning](Self Service Provisioning.md) as early as possible to free up these valuable people. Don't waste them on admin tasks.

* **The testing team** - As we know if we want continuous delivery at high velocity we have to have good quality tests. Everyone knows developers and sysadmins are are too lazy or stupid to write good test right? (WRONG)

* **The product management team** - This is the group of **business** product owners that find it hard to get involved in the day to day delivering of experiments to customers. They believe that spending all their time with customers gains us valuable insights (really? didn't we talk about this already?). They band together in committees to construct "joined up product strategies" with 3 year roadmaps. The normal reaction is to find an IT person to fulfill the role of product owner but this rarely works well as the IT folks are rarely empowered to make the big decisions.

* **The Security Team** - It's important for security folks to be grounded in reality, we embed them in product teams so we can make fast decisions about whats "secure enough" but then someone has to be responsible for collecting the data about vulnerabilities, auditing the projects and ticking the compliance boxes so we can present the numbers in the right way and have a nice time when the regulators drop by. We have to fix as much of this as we can with [Compliance automation](Compliance Automation.md)

* **The enterprise architects** - (Oh oh... thats me). Enterprise architects have a reputation for sitting in ivory towers drawing intricate diagrams of little connected boxes, dropping into projects every now and then to say "No, thats the wrong way... do it this way for the good of the whole company". We put them into product teams because tehy have wide business and technical domain knowledge. We use them to gain insights into common real world problems and lead collaboration across teams to find common solutions. This takes real courage but many architects are introverted techies at heart who have come up through the ranks.

## TL;DR
* Destroy all the silos
* Spread the skills around and encourage mentoring/coaching (make T shaped people)
* Make all the stakeholders involved in delivering customer outcomes work in product teams.
* If you are not delivering customer outcomes what the hell are you doing?
