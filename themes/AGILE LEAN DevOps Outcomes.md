# ALDO (Agile, Lean, DevOps Outcomes)

As we begin to transform our organisations to be more responsive to customer needs it's helpful to adopt proven methods and frameworks. The most common methods we see organisations adopting are aligned to delivering software at high velocity to achieve **CUSTOMER OUTCOMES**.

As we begin to spread these methods across the organisation, its important to understand what value they add and how they are related.

## LEAN

LEAN is a methodology for improving customer value by eliminating waste. Waste is defined as anything which doesn't contribute to customer value or which causes "strain" due to poor organisation. We think about LEAN in terms of:-

* **Value** - What is valuable to a customer and how do we measure it objectively
* **Value stream mapping** - Understanding the value contributed by steps in our processes
* **Capability** - Understanding how capable, available and flexible are the steps in our processes
* **Flow** - Only performing actions that get value to the customer faster
* **Pull** - Only make what the customer is pulling from you (using and ideally buying)


LEAN embraces **continuous improvement** - Removal of steps that don't add value, fixing broken steps, removing bottlenecks, adjusting capacity, eliminating silos and supervision.

## AGILE

AGILE is related to LEAN by **value**, **waste**, **flow** and **pull**.

In order to avoid analysis paralysis and eliminate the **waste** from unnecessary work, we break work into small batches and we defer planning and design until we are ready to execute.

* We have an overarching vision which guides our direction and decisions
* "Stories" describe examples of our vision from different viewpoints
* We "elaborate" our stories into design/build tasks only when its time to implement them.
* Tasks are placed in a backlog and prioritised into time boxed "sprints"

In order to measure the **value** we are creating for the customer, and improve **flow**, we need to deliver something to our customer in every sprint.

* We measure the value of features based on **pull** from our customers
* We reflect on what held us back so we can improve our conditions
* We reflect on what went well so we can celebrate the achievements
* We demo to our stakeholders to get feedback on features and prioritise the backlog
* We aggressively eliminate things from the backlog which are no longer relevant

## DevOps

DevOps is all about the **flow** and the **waste**. We organise ourselves into cross functional product teams which are empowered and have the skills to make decisions about how to deliver software to customers as fast as possible.

* We improve **flow** by eliminating silos that require handoffs and supervisory processes
* We improve **flow** by making sure all the decision makers sit in the product teams and are accountable for delivering at the highest possible velocity.
* We improve **flow** by ensuring every product team has the skills (or access to them) to perform any required task immediately.
* We improve **flow** by automation of time consuming manual tasks
* We reduce **waste** by automation of error prone tasks
