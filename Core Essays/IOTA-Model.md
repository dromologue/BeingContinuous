![IOTA Model](https://github.com/dromologue/BeingContinuous/blob/master/Diagrammes/IOTA%20Model.png)

We are able to identify two tensions that frame our product development activities: 
+ A tension between what we value and what the customer values. 
+ A tension between how we think about the world (of the customer, our team etc.) and how we act in it. 

These are shown in the model as a matrix, identifying 4 stages in a cycle of product development. 
+ Hypothesis formation 
+ Capability building → essentially a list of features / stories. 
+ Condition improvement → a list of stories that do not impact the customer now but improve the teams ability. 
+ Target measurement.
