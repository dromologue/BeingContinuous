The Transformation Workshop is the central component in the Continuous Transformation method. 

The Transformation Workshop is run over 3 days, although the attendees are not the same across all days.

The workshop is designed to:
+ Assemble a group of people who will work on a project together.
+ Facilitate a shared view of the desired outcome and the practices by which that outcome will be achieved.
+ Create visible accountability for that outcome across the whole team and their management structures. 
+ Produce experience in the use of certain key models and tools that will be used throughout the project's lifespan.

The output of the workshop is:
+ 1 or more projects with a high level technical and commercial vision defined.
+ A backlog of user stories [(for Product 1 and Product 2)](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/The-Two-Product-Principle) within this high level scope.
+ A sprint plan for the next 2 week sprint. 
+ A clear shot term strategy for the use of available technology and tool, operation in terms of existing organisational processes (which may include ignoring them) and allocation of resources from across the organisation. 

Conditions for Optimum Success are:
+ Full stack representation. This means that 'business' or product owners, infrastructure and operations staff, developers, architects, security and compliance experts should all be present for at least the first 3 days. 
+ Executive mandate to allocate resources across organisational boundaries and suspend certain processes as required.
+ Off-site location ensures attendees do not get pulled into other meetings while at the workshop. 

A [Facilitation Guide](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/Facilitation-Guide) shows the allocation of topics and exercises over the 5 days.
