Since Day 1 is mostly talking, it is important to break it up with small group discussions on the topics every hour or so. 
There are also [Energy Exercises](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/Energy-Exercises) that may be used. 

A Facilitated Discussion
If projects have not already been chosen prior to the workshop, a discussion is facilitated on choosing a project where we can test these ideas.
