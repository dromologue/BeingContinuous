...You're in the right place.

This wiki outlines the [conceptual foundations](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/Conceptual-Foundations) and core tools of a transformation practice and provides a [Facilitation Guide](https://github.com/dromologue/BeingContinuous/wiki/Facilitation-Guide) for running a [Transformation Workshop](https://github.com/dromologue/BeingContinuous/wiki/Transformation-Workshop) using the core Tools and Models - [IOTA Model](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/IOTA-Model), [ROAR Model](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/ROAR-Model), [Crucible Process](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/Crucible-Process) and [ELSA Model](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/ELSA-Model). 
The Topics to be covered are described [here](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/Key-Topics).

The basic idea in this approach is the use of a workshop to create a full stack delivery team for a product (or set of features) so that the organisation creates one working example of what it looks like to operate as a high velocity product development business. The chaining of these workshops, coupled with typical agile coaching as the projects proceed creates a maker-driven movement for change in the organisation - doers talking to other doers producing great stuff - that is linked to real business value through the rapid iteration of product and it's delivery to customers.
