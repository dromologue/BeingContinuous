The topics are broken up into four categories, loosely modelled on the IOTA model itself:

+ [Describing the Business Today](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/Describing-the-Business-Today)
+ [Deciding What we need to do about it](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/Deciding-What-to-do)
+ [Designing Products and Teams that Continuously Improve](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/Designing-Teams-and-Products)
+ [Discovering what worked](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/Discovering-What-Works)

Each of these areas list topics that may be covered in the workshop. Some references are shown to provide background to the ideas themselves. Users are free to add additional topics to these pages and / or extend the coverage here. 

You should also have a look at the [Book List](https://github.com/dromologue/ContinuousTransformation/wiki/Book-List).
