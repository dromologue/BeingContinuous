## Some Exercises to increase Energy in the room. 

### Topic Circle
+ Get everyone into a circle. Choose someone to start. 
+ The starter picks a topic, e.g. Names and chooses something that falls within that topic, e.g. James.
+ The next person, moving clockwise, picks another item in that same topic but starting with the letter that the previous item _ended_ with, i.e. 'S'.
+ If anyone repeats an item or hesitates... the topic changes and the 'hesitator' stands in the middle of the circle. 
+ The objective of the game is to get around the full circle with as few people standing in the middle as possible. 

--> Pro-Tip... people will assume that they can't help each other. Wait for them to find out that they can. Running this game a few times over a couple of days can be fun as the group tries to beat its record. 

### Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS)
+ I assume you know the underlying game...
+ This works best if people are already in teams.
+ Get everyone to pair off and run a 'best of 3' RPS game with their partners.
+ The winner of each pair plays the winner of another pair in the same team. The losers... and this is important...have to vocally cheer for the person who beat them. 
+ Eventually you get to a team winner, who plays the winner of the other team...
+ Until you get a Champion. 

--> Pro-tip... you want it loud. You might even give a prize to the winner.
